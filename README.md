# MULTI-AXIS-MECHATRONIC-MULTI-AXIS-MECHATRONIC-MULTI-AXIS-MECHATRONIC-OBJECT-HANDLING-SYSTEM
A Wi-Fi–controlled mobile robot with a multi-axis robotic arm enables real-time remote control of movement and pick-and-place tasks using an ESP32 and a mobile app. It offers a low-cost, flexible solution for education, training, and small-scale automation.



The project presents a comprehensive overview of a multi-axis mechatronic object handling system developed as part of an engineering program in Electronics and Communication. It highlights the motivation, design, implementation, and outcomes of a Wi-Fi–controlled mobile robot integrated with a robotic arm.

The main objective is to overcome the limitations of traditional wired robotic systems that restrict mobility, flexibility, and ease of operation. To achieve this, the system uses an ESP32 microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and the Blynk IoT platform, enabling real-time remote control of both the robot’s movement and its multi-axis robotic arm through a single mobile application.

The system consists of a four-wheel mobile base driven by DC motors and a robotic arm operated using servo motors. Commands from a smartphone are transmitted through the cloud to the controller, which processes the data and generates control signals for coordinated navigation and pick-and-place operations. This wireless approach removes physical constraints and allows flexible operation from any location with internet access.

The methodology covers hardware integration, power management, software configuration, and communication setup. Key components such as the motor driver, voltage regulator, and rechargeable battery ensure stable performance and efficient power usage. The software is developed using Arduino IDE and Arduino C/C++ to achieve reliable real-time motor and servo control.

Experimental results show that the system performs pick-and-place tasks accurately and responsively. Its cost-effective design makes it suitable for education, small-scale automation, and industrial training. While the current system relies on manual control and stable connectivity, future enhancements include sensor integration, autonomous navigation, and AI-based object recognition.

Overall, the project demonstrates a practical and scalable approach to integrating robotics, embedded systems, and IoT technologies, showcasing how modern wireless control platforms can transform traditional robotic systems into flexible, user-friendly, and affordable automation solutions for both academic and real-world applications.
